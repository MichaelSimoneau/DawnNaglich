# Dawn Naglich Wellness Style Guide

## Brand Philosophy
Elite, healing-focused, and restorative. The visual identity is built on a "Monochromatic Green" theme, which signifies wellness, growth, and neurological balance.

## Color Palette
Using the Tailwind CSS Emerald scale for consistency:
- **Primary Accent**: `#10B981` (Emerald-500) - Used for primary call-to-actions, markers, and living brand elements.
- **Deep Background**: `#022C22` (Emerald-950) - Used for dark layouts and primary branding.
- **Strong Green**: `#064E3B` (Emerald-900) - Used for header text on light backgrounds and secondary branding.
- **Soft Light Green**: `#ECFDF5` (Emerald-50) - Used for light component backgrounds and successful states.
- **Muted Green**: `#D1FAE5` (Emerald-100) - Used for border accents and subtle highlights.

## Typography
- **Headers**: `Playfair Display` - Serif font for an elite, high-end therapeutic feel.
- **Body/System**: `Inter` - Clean, modern sans-serif for readability and functional clarity.

## Layout Principles
- **Spacing**: Generous padding (minimum 24px/6 units) to create a sense of breathability and calm.
- **Radius**: Large border-radii (20px to 32px) for a soft, inviting organic feel.
- **Glassmorphism**: Use `backdrop-blur-3xl` with low-opacity emerald overlays for high-end navigation and overlays.
- **Shadows**: Soft, colored shadows (using emerald tints) rather than harsh blacks.

## Iconography
- Consistent use of FontAwesome 6 (Solid/Brands).
- Icon accents should always be in the Primary Accent color (#10B981).
